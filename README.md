Create a moving plot of linear or horizontal motion. 

# Abstract / Intro
The purpose of this project is to visualize the cadence of motion of a tracked video subject in a single dimension (x or y). This allows one to see the degree of linearity or non-linearity in motion of a particular subject. In the case of animation, this is a useful study tool as one can isolate a dimension of movement and better learn the established art form.
